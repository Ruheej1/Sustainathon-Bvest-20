## Problem Identified: 
Lack of awareness among younger generation about the global pandemic of COVID 19 and a need to spread basic knowledge in an interactive way.


## Solution and Idea:
We will create a game using JavaScript and Html canvas which incorporates learning in itself as it will be based on preventive measures to take while dealing with coronavirus. In this game, the user will first be prompted to choose an avatar and then run along a road where he/she will encounter different types of things and he has to choose whether that thing will improve his immunity or not. Then if he encounters the virus, then he can use the protective shield tool to prevent himself from getting infected. Also, there will be a 14 second freezing period when he gets contracted by virus which is indicative of the 14-day quarantine cycle. In this way, we intend to inculcate basic knowledge about the global pandemic among children which will help in further spreading the knowledge to a greater audience.

## Benefits:
* 1. Easy and interactive way to learn
* 2. Reduces stress, anxiety and decreases the taboo created around the virus.
* 3. If the younger generation becomes aware, their parents and elderly become more cautious and thoughtful about their actions and so the norms are followed in the house and   prevention from virus is taken care of.

## Intended Approach: 
* Plan 1: Build the game from scratch, add different rounds and levels.
* Plan 2: Innovation in every round and different Avatars to be introduced.
* Plan 3: Final creation of the entire game and debugging.
